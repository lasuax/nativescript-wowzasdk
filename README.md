# Nativescript-wowzasdk

Deploying a plugin for WowzaSDK for Nativescript community. It's still in progress and do not hesitate to pull and add something you want :)

## (Optional) Prerequisites / Requirements

No prerequisites needed. Install, config and start to use.

## Installation

There's a private npm repo at the moment but it's not wise to make it public while unfinished so grab it from here.

```javascript
tns plugin add <your-plugin-name>
```

## Usage 

I need to finish the project to write the documentation.
	
	```javascript
    Usage code snippets here
    ```)

## API

Describe your plugin methods and properties here. See [nativescript-feedback](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-feedback) for example.
    
| Property | Default | Description |

| some property | property default value | property description, default values, etc.. |
